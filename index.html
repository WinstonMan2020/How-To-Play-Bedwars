    <p>Hypixel has 2 main games. Skyblock, and Bedwars. In this tutorial, I'll be covering how to play Bedwars!</p>
    <h1><b>The Fundamentals</b></h1>
    <p>The rules of Bedwars are simple. You have a bed, and your generator produces iron and gold. You use those resources to buy items such as weapons and blocks. You can respawn, but if your bed gets destroyed you'll be set to your last life. </p>
    <h1>Strategy</h1>
    <p>There are multiple strategies that different players use to try to win a Bedwars game. The most common, however, is called rushing. This is where you wait until you (usually) get 16 iron and 4 gold, buy a tnt and a stack of blocks and immediately go to another player's base. Build up and get the high ground, then blow up their bed defense using the tnt. If you get the timing right, you can jump down right when the tnt explodes their bed defense and breka their bed.</p>
    <h1>PvP</h1>
    <p>PvP is where you fight other players using swords, bows, and other damaging items (potions, flint and steel, tnt, fireballs, etc.). To get better at PvP you can watch tutorials on how to get combos (which is where you hit an enemy multiple times without them hitting you) and resetting your knockback to more easily acctivate combos. </p>
